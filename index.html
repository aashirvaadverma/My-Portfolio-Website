                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>You might be wondering why there are so many coffee images in my portfolio — it's because I love coffee!<br>
                <br>Hi, I'm <strong>Aashirvaad Verma</strong>, a beginner web developer, a YouTuber, and sometimes an artist.
                I enjoy experimenting with small projects — I build them to learn, try new ideas, and sometimes even delete them after experimenting.<br>
                <br>I started my programming journey back in fifth standard, where I was first introduced to Scratch (build games and stories by blocks containing code).
                After that came Quick Basic (QB64), then came C++ (still one of the toughest ones for me), followed by Python and Java.
                Currently, I'm focused on building for the web using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm excited to learn more as I go.<br>
                <br>Apart from coding, I also create YouTube videos — mostly gameplay content — as it's one of my hobbies.
                My channel is called <strong>Cold Coffee Gaming</strong>, inspired (of course) by my love for coffee.<br>
                <br>Art is another big part of my life. I enjoy visiting art galleries and museums, exploring different art forms, and sketching in my free time.
                As a kid, I loved crafting things from paper and random objects, and one thing still on my art bucket list is learning pottery and creating pots of different shapes and sizes.<br>
